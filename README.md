<h1>ðŸš€ Getting Started</h1>
To get started, download the zip file of the repository. Or use <br>
<code>git clone https://github.com/d17012002/event-management</code><br>
Then navigate to the project's root directory. The project consists of three folders: `client`, `server`, and `developer`.
<br>
Before starting the servers, make sure to install the dependencies by running the command: <code> npm install </code> in all three folders.
<br>

- For the client-side, start the server by running the command: <code>npm run dev</code><br>
- For the server-side, start the server by running the command: <code>nodemon index.js</code><br>
- For the developer-side, start the server by running the command: <code>npm run dev</code><br>
  <br>

<h1>ðŸ‘‰ How to use the site</h1>
Our event management system has three main components:

<ul>
  <li><strong>User:</strong> Users can sign in or sign up and access the user dashboard to view and register for events.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Admins can log in to create events, view their events, and manage registrations for their events.</li>
  <li><strong>Developer:</strong> Developers can access the developer site to create new admins (later this feature will be available only to product managers).</li>
</ul>
